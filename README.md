Revolution Web Services (RWS) is a simple open-source command line tool for Revolution attendees to view their schedules, chat with other attendees, and more.



## Using RWS

RWS is currently in early development, and no formal release is available yet.

When RWS is finished, you can log in via rws.revohacks.com or via a dedicated .net console app.
